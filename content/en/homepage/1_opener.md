## Places of Eorzea: A 24/7 Journey Through Eorzea

Welcome, adventurer, to **Places of Eorzea**, a passion project dedicated to bringing the beautiful, ever-changing world of Final Fantasy XIV directly to you. This is more than just a stream; it's a window into the daily life of Eorzea, running non-stop, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. My mission is to capture the quiet, ambient moments of this vibrant worldâ€”the bustling streets of Limsa Lominsa, the serene landscapes of the Black Shroud, and the breathtaking vistas of the Dravanian Forelands.

## My Inspiration: A Nostalgic Vibe

My project is a spiritual successor to the beloved ["Live Vana'diel"](https://www.youtube.com/@FINALFANTASYXI/streams) streams that once provided a constant, calming presence for fans of Final Fantasy XI. That same sense of a living, breathing world, observed from a distance, is what I aim to recreate here for Final Fantasy XIV. I want to provide a space where you can unwind, set the stream as a background, and simply exist within the world of Hydaelyn, whether you're crafting, studying, or just relaxing.

## The Heart of the Project: Humble Tech, Big Commitment

Places of Eorzea is a grassroots endeavor, built and maintained entirely from a home-based setup. The stream is powered by a small, dedicated computer running on standard residential internet. Because it's a self-funded project, I don't have the resources for a complex, high-end streaming rig or a dedicated server connection.

This simple setup means that while my commitment is to a nonstop broadcast, I are dependent on the stability of my home internet connection. Please be aware that unplanned outages, maintenance from my internet provider, or even brief power flickers could take the stream offline for an unknown period of time. I will always work to get it back up as quickly as possible, but I appreciate your patience if the broadcast is interrupted. My focus isn't on perfect graphics or high frame rates; it's on providing an uninterrupted, ambient view of Eorzea for as long as my setup allows.

## Join Us on the Journey

Whether you're a long-time player who misses the simple days of adventuring, a new one looking to get a feel for the world outside of quests, or someone who just loves the atmosphere of Final Fantasy, I invite you to tune in. Places of Eorzea is a fun-project from a fan, for the fans. I hope you'll enjoy this peaceful, continuous journey through the realm we all call home.

## Want to Help Out?

Places of Eorzea is a genuine passion project, and I'm dedicated to keeping the stream running around the clock. Everything you see is powered by a home-based setup, which comes with its own costs, from electricity to maintaining the hardware.

If you enjoy the ambient experience and want to support the stream's uptime and future improvements, you can help me out with a cup of coffee. Your support, no matter how small, would go a long way in covering operational costs and helping me work towards potential upgrades for better stability.

It's never expected, but always deeply appreciated.
